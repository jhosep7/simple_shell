.SH NAME
simple_shell - SHELL (standard command line interpreter)
.SH SYNOPSIS
hsh [-flag] [arguments]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The hsh utility reads and interprets a command
line string in either interactive or non-interactive mode.
Later excecutes commands based on the input, then the local
directory and the PATH are seeked.
Depending of the application, the function prints to either
stdout(standard output) or stderr(standard error).

The shell is a program that reads lines from either a file or the terminal,
interprets them, and  executes other commands. Commands can be typed
directly to the running shell.

the keyboard.
